The editor should enforce the 70 column width maximum mercilessly.

The user should be able to log into StarTeam, check out the latest revision.txt 
for a project, update it and check it back in.  Should also be able to add a 
label from within the tool after check-in, or as part of the check-in process.

The editor already keeps some configuration data in the user's registry, add more
as needed.

Game Selection:
The user should be able to browse the PC4 EGM server for game projects.  The 
project browser will filter out all projects that don't begin with "PC4G" since
all game projects begin with this tag.

Once a game is selected the editor will populate the view combo box.  The user
can select the correct view from the list.  This might be better displayed as 
a tree view given the hierarchical nature of the data.

Selecting the view should then populate the two label combo boxes.  Selecting 
a starting label should cause the ending label combo box to select the next 
label in the set such that the end is never earlier than the start.

Nevada Modification Document Generation:
Track first submission date.

Only provide the initial game description with first release regardless of
subsequent revisions.  Later submissions will contain only changes made 
since the last submission date.

Tracking of submission dates - 
Keep xml file with revision.txt?
Embed in the label description?
